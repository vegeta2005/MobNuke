 * <b>The download can be found in the "target" folder</b>


<b>Commands:</b>
<br>/nukehelp for a list of commands.</br>
<br>/blastpower for the current blast power (default 150).</br>
<br>/setblastpower to set the blast power (max 300).</br>
<br>/givenuke to give a nuke to the target player.</br>


<b>Crafting:</b> A player can craft a warhead in survival with: 1 tnt in the center and 2 emerald blocks (one above the tnt and one below the tnt).

<b>Compass:</b> The player can use a compass to measure the exact distance between themself and the blast point.
(they can also see how many blocks the fallout has spread in all directions)

<b>Fallout:</b> When a warhead is detonated, fallout will spread in all directions from the blast point for a duration (BlastPower divided by 2).
-Players will experience stages of health effects based on how long they are exposed to fallout radiation:
* Stage 0 - Initial Exposure (Warning message)
* Stage 1 - Sluggishness (Slowness III)
* Stage 2 - Nausea (Hunger X)
* Stage 3 - Organ Failure (Wither III)
* Stage 4 - Death
(Players wearing full netherite armor are immune to fallout radiation!)
<br><i>*Fallout spreads at a speed of 1 block per second</i></br>

<b>Using a Warhead:</b>
Right-click the warhead against the ground to spawn a blaze warhead. Attack the blaze one time (killing it doesn't matter) to set off the nuke.\
-A warhead will detonate after 10 seconds.\
-Any entity caught in the warhead's blast will be set on fire for 10 seconds
